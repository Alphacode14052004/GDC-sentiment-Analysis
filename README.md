# Project Title: Mental Health Sentiment Analysis with PEFT-Finetuned Llama-2

# Description:

This project explores sentiment analysis of text related to mental health using a large language model (LLM) called Llama-2, fine-tuned with the PEFT (Persistence Enhanced Fine-Tuning) technique. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, or very negative) of text from online support groups for cancer survivors and caregivers.

# Key Features:

Employs the LLAMA-2 LLM model with 7B parameters
Utilizes PEFT for efficient fine-tuning
Quantization with Bits & Bytes for memory optimization
Leverages Hugging Face Transformers and SFT for training
Calculates accuracy, class scores, and confusion matrix for model evaluation
Installation:

# Prerequisites:

Python 3.7 or later
PyTorch
Transformers
bitsandbytes
peft
accelerate
datasets
trl
tensorboard
Install packages using pip:

Bash
```
pip install numpy pandas transformers bitsandbytes accelerate peft trl
```
Use code with caution.

# Dataset:

CSV file containing text and sentiment labels (e.g., "mental_health_sentiment_analysis.csv")
Instructions:

Download the model and tokenizer:

Python
```
model_name = "/kaggle/input/llama-2/pytorch/7b-hf/1"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
Use code with caution.
Load and preprocess the dataset (refer to the code for detailed steps).
Fine-tune the model using PEFT (refer to the code for training configuration).
Evaluate model performance on a test set.
Generate predictions on new text inputs.
```
```

Additional Notes:

Adjust hyperparameters and model configuration as needed for optimal results.
Experiment with different prompt engineering techniques.
Consider error analysis for further model improvement.
Troubleshooting:

If you encounter the NameError: name 'pd' is not defined error, ensure you have imported the pandas library with import pandas as pd.
Refer to the documentation for the libraries used for more detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips.
